DTSTART:20210715T224500Z
DTEND:20210715T234500Z
UID:719305
DESCRIPTION:This past year\, due to the pandemic\, more gamers than ever t
 urned to cooperative games as a way to stay connected with friends and fam
 ily. These indie developers have found innovative ways to push co-op gamep
 lay in a relatively new and unexplored direction: that of asymmetrical co-
 op gaming. In these games\, the two players can't see each other's screen 
 and must therefore rely on verbal communication to move forward. In other 
 words\, talking is gameplay here. The result is the potential to appeal to
  a broader range of players - men and women\, young and old\, casual and e
 xperienced. We discuss the challenges and opportunities in designing for a
 symmetrical co-op play\, what we hope to see for the future of this co-op 
 genre\, and what we learned about the way we play together.\n\n@cleverplay
